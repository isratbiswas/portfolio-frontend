#My Portfolio

🖥️ Frontend Overview

My portfolio website is built with Next.js, a powerful React framework that combines server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), and client-side rendering (CSR) to deliver fast, SEO-friendly, and scalable web applications.

⚙️ Core Technologies

Next.js 14+ (App Router) – For hybrid rendering, routing, and optimized performance.

React 18 – For building interactive, component-based UI.

TypeScript – For type safety, scalability, and cleaner code.

Tailwind CSS – For modern, responsive, and utility-first styling.

Framer Motion – For smooth animations and transitions that enhance UX.

Shadcn/UI & Lucide Icons – For elegant, accessible, and customizable UI components.

🧩 Frontend Architecture

App Directory Structure using Next.js App Router (app/) for layouts, pages, and server actions.

Modular Component Design: Reusable UI components (buttons, cards, modals, forms) stored in components/ui/.

Context API / Zustand / Redux RTK (optional) – For state management depending on project scale.

Dynamic Routing – Handles pages like /projects/[id] and /blogs/[id] dynamically.

API Integration – Securely connected with my backend using environment variables (NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_API).

⚡ Performance & Optimization

Image Optimization via Next.js <Image /> component.

Automatic Code Splitting and Lazy Loading for faster page loads.

Metadata API for SEO and Open Graph support.

Responsive Design across all screen sizes.

🔐 Authentication & Authorization

Integrated with NextAuth.js for secure login/logout.

🚀 Deployment & Hosting

🌿 Design Philosophy

A clean, modern, and natural look — inspired by indoor plants 🌱.
Soft green tones, rounded edges, and minimal UI elements make the interface calm yet professional.
